=short

<p>The base type for many complex definitions.  They are defined
as rather stand-alone things, but tied together via their name.</p>

=schema

==xml
<element name="reusable" type="b:Reusable" abstract="true" />

<complexType name="Reusable">
  <sequence />
  <attribute      ref="b:name" />
</complexType>
==end

=description

<p>The Unit's data consists of different blocks of information, which
can be referred to from other places within the Unit or even from
outside the Unit.  The reference is made via a <SCHEMA>b:Fragment</SCHEMA>,
but only works when the Unit has a <SCHEMA>b:name</SCHEMA> attribute.</p>

<p>Even when there is at a certain moment no need to give a reusable
component a name, it might simplify the use of the Unit later or optimize
lookups a bit.</p>
