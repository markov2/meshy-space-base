<p>Units belong to a Namespace.  The namespace may have structure,
and may have a complex life-cycle.</p>

<element name="namespace" type="b:Namespace"
   substitutionGroup="b:native" />

<complexType name="Namespace">

    <extension base="b:Native">

=description

<p>The namespace groups units into sets.  In the Meshy Space Concept
abstraction, they become Collections (<SCHEMA>c:collection</SCHEMA>).

<p>The <code>id</code> of this Unit is blank, to indicate that it is ruling
the namespace or subspace; when you query a namespace for its blank Unit, you
get the <i>root</i> Namespace Unit.</p>

<p>The <i>root</i> namespace requires a <SCHEMA>b:prefix</SCHEMA>
element to define its default prefix.</p>

=element path-separator

<p>The path-separator for Subspaces are inherited from the enclosing
Namespace.</p>

=element language

<p>This provides a hint which language settings the owner of the Namespace
or Subspace (inherited) uses.  The default for the <code>language</code>
on the root Namespace is <UNIT>ms:Language/en-US</UNIT>.</p>

=element moved

<p>Rewrite rules (<SCHEMA>b:moved</SCHEMA>) are used to migrate from one
namespace structure into a new one.  <SCHEMA>b:UnitID</SCHEMA>s can survive
very long, so you SHOULD support old structures when your set-up changes.</p>

<p>This is <b>NOT</b> a symbolic link, hard link, temporary or permanent
redirection: the old structure SHOULD be rewritten whenever achievable.</p>

=element subspace

<p>Subspaces (<SCHEMA>b:subspace</SCHEMA>) are "children" of a Namespace
or other Subspaces.  They have a location with respect to their "parent".
They MAY have their own rules.</p>

=element fetch

<p>To allow Units to refer to locations on internet via relative URIs,
the Subspaces can define a link base.  Usually, this is an absolute URI.
A relative URI will be based on the wrapping Subspace.  The root Namespace
uses its <code>endpoint</code> as absolute base.</p>

<p>When the same data can be loaded via different protocols, for instance
<code>http:</code>, <code>https:</code>, and <code>s3:</code>, you can
pass them all.  It is to the user to decide which alternative is used.
Also: you may give addresses for download "mirrors": the same protocol
but pointing to different geographically spread servers.</p>

=element manager

<p>When specified, this Namespace is managed by a more intelligent
level.  The basic functionality of the Unit handling will be controled
by a management application.</p>

<p>There currently is only one Manager, which is implemented by
the Meshy Space Concept.  In that case, the <code>manager</code>
points to a <UNIT>ms:Type/Collection</UNIT> unit.</p>
=example Namespace switching path-separator

<p>Let us assume that our collection of company internal network information
is accessible via endpoint <code>https://facts.example.com/network</code>.
When assign prefix <code>net:</code> to that namespace for our convenience.</p>

<p class="list">The Namespace tree could be designed like this:</p>
<CODE>
net:                path-sep = '/'
 ├─> ipv4           path-sep = '.'
 │     ├─> 10           Subnet free to use
 │     └─> 192.168.1    Subnet managed by someone
 │           ├─> 11         Unit for host
 │           └─> 12         Unit for host
 └─> ipv6           path-sep = ':'
       └─> 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000
             └─> 8a2e   Subnet managed by someone
                  └─> 0370:7334   Unit for service
</CODE>
<p>The absolute address of host <code>11</code> is <code>net:ipv4/192.168.1.11</code>.
Via Meshy Space Concept, the owner of <code>net:</code> can give other people
(identities) the right to maintain Subspaces.</p>
