<p>A units may define relations to other Units: it <SCHEMA>b:has</SCHEMA>
additional references.  These relations are references (<SCHEMA>b:UnitRef</SCHEMA>).</p>

<p>When many Units in a Collection have a structurally consistent relation to
a different Collection, than that other Collection is a "shadow" of the first.
When needed, the Rules of the first Collection can include a generic reference
with optionally a rewrite rule (<SCHEMA>b:shadow</SCHEMA> element in
the <SCHEMA>b:has</SCHEMA>).</p>
