<p class="list">Usually, a <SCHEMA>ms:unit</SCHEMA> has a content: the <i>payload</i>.
This has two main variations:</p>

<ul>
<li><SCHEMA>ms:native</SCHEMA> payloads are (XML) message components which
    nicely integrate in the unit structure.  In these units, not only the
    wrapper, but also the payload data is defined in one of the Meshy Space
    schemas.</li>
<li><SCHEMA>ms:content</SCHEMA> payloads produce bytes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please see <a href="examples.html">the examples</a> to learn about
ways to arrange the payload.</p>
