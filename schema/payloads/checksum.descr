=description

<p>Contains a checksum of the byte content.</p>

<p><b>Be aware</b> that MD5 sums are fast but not safe against directed attacks.
SHA1 sums are close to be breached.  When you do trust the source of your
bytes, there is nothing wrong with them.  But when your data is transported
over multiple or unprotected infrastructure, then you should use better sums.</p>

=attribute by

<p>The Constant which indicates which kind of sum has been
applied.  In the <code>ms:</code> namespace, they are named
<code>ms:Checksum/&lt;something&gt;</code>.</p>
