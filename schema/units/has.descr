<p>A unit <i>has</i> references to another unit for a certain
reason.</p>

=description

<p class="list">We can think of many reasons for relations.  The reason
is expressed via the <code>ms:is</code> attribute, which contains a
name-spaced constant.  The attributes are typical selectors to find
the right relation to follow, the elements are informational.</p>

=attribute is

<p>The <code>ms:is</code> attribute explains the <code>ms:has</code>
relation.  When the relation unknown, the client may need to collect
the related unit to inspect its content, but that is expensive so
should be avoided.</p>

<p>The relation (constant) may also be unknown to the client.  In that
case, the client is RECOMMENDED to ignore the relation.  The client MAY
warn its user that there is information which is not understood.</p>

<p>When you download a unit, you can specify the namespaces and relations
of the related (<SCHEMA>ms:has</SCHEMA>) units to be downloaded in the
same go as well.  For instance, within the Meshy Space Concept, a request
for a certain <code>msc:Role/Collection</code> will ask to include the
related units with relation <code>msc:Role/Rules</code>.  Or more general,
probably request for all <code>msc:Role/</code> Units.</p>

=attribute type

<p>The type of the content of Unit where this relation refers to, which
MAY optimize some processes.  This is indicative only: the processors
SHALL check whether is field is correct, and MAY cast a warning on
mistakes.</p>

<p>Usually, this element is not really useful: the processor can better
retreive the Unit and then check whether it is able to handle it.</p>

<p>Many relations support different object typess.  For instance,
the Identity of the owner of the Unit can be a single person, a group,
and so on.  Which kind of Identity it is, does not really matter in the
main code of the processor.</p>

=attribute seqnr

<p>When there are multiple relations which are of the same kind (same
<code>ms:is</code>), they may need to be ordered like an array.</p>

=example in the Meshy Space Concept frame

<p>Not all inter-unit relations are the same: some are generic enough
to be defined by MSI, where others have a looser or non-standardized
relation.  It may also be smart to put lesser-used information about
a unit into a separate unit: for instance the history of the unit.</p>
