<p>A group of fields which maintain the status of the unit; units
may require maintenance, even when you do not like it.  First read

=description

<p>The <code>revision</code> MUST be upgraded each time the unit
sees any change: it is used to invalidate cached values.
Revisions are ASCII sortable strings.  Only the newest revision of a
unit should be used by your program: older revisions have value.</p>

<p>The <code>revision</code> defaults to <code>updated</code>, which
is an ordered date format.  On its turn, <code>updated</code> defaults
to <code>created</code>.</p>

<p>For each of the time-stamps, you will not see who has set or
changed them inside the unit itself: that could become quite expensive.
The collection of units MAY have a separate archive which contains or
produces change-logs.  See <UNIT>msc:Type/ChangeLog</UNIT>.</p>

=element revision

<p>See <SCHEMA>b:revision</SCHEMA>.  Defaults to the value of
<code>updated</code>, which contains a date which is string-sortable.</p>

=element created

<p>This tells you something about the moment data has been collected for
the first time: the moment the Unit appeared in the system.</p>

=element updated

<p>The "last-modified" time-stamp reflects any change on the data or
meta-data of the unit.  This includes changes detected in the
references which the unit <code>has</code> to other data.</p>

<p>The <code>revision</code> is already increased on each of the updates,
which will automatically upgrade all copies of the unit.  The revision
may look like a date, but does not need to be.</p>

<p><code>Updated</code> defaults to <code>created</code>.</p>

=element deprecate

<p>This tells the Collection when the author of the Unit wants it to
get deprecated.  The expression must produce a timestamp: be an absolute
dateTime or a duration after the moment of publication.</p>

<p>When a unit has a deprecated time which is in the past, then attempts
should be made to warn the user of data in the unit.  Details can be
found in the unit's change-log.  Warnings MUST be throttled to an
acceptable level, say a maximum of once per hour.

=element expire

<p>This tells the Collection when the Unit wants to get expired.
The expression must produce a timestamp: be an absolute dateTime or
a duration after the moment of publication.</p>

<p>When a unit has expired, it SHALL NOT be used anymore.  It MUST
be thrown away within a reasonable period, but at least within
one hour after expiration.</p>

<p>Also, Units which are packaged may expire.  In this case, the whole
package is expired.  When there are still units inside that package which
are not expired, you MUST either expire them as well or repackage them.
Probably the latter.  This may be expensive.</p>

=element revisit

<p>The maximum in which you have to check whether you still have the
latest revision of a unit.  When you use a cached unit (of any type)
you must check whether the collection which contains that unit has
to be upgraded, using the <UNIT>ms:Op.upgrade</UNIT> operation.
All reported changes need to be processed before you can continue.</p>

<p>It is RECOMMENDED to have a background process performing this task,
such that "normal" processed are not delayed in the synchronization.
Upgrades of units are shown as atomic operations.</p>

<p>It is RECOMMENDED to revisit the units at least every half of the
revisit duration.  You SHALL have revisited the unit before the timespan
has ended, or throw the cached revision of the unit away.</p>

<p>You SHALL not keep the revision unit in any form after the revisit
timespan has passed without revision attempt, to comply to law.</p>

=discuss Repackaging after expiration

<p>We cannot tolerate the distribution of expired data, because
their termination means that the license has expired or the content
is withdrawn.  For instance, the unit may contain illegal content.
Or has broken content.  You do not have a choice: repackaging and
redistribution is obligatory.</p>

<p>You do not have to repackage the unit's data on updates or
deprecations: simply patch the meta-data of the unit.</p>
