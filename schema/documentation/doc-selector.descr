=description

<p>Documentation is grouped.  There are many ways to organize the
grouping.  At the end, for each piece of documentation it must be
clean when it can be used.  Attributes which are missing are taken
from the context.</p>

=attribute unit

<p>Refers to the Unit where this documentation belongs to.  By default,
the current Unit.  This attribute is required for <SCHEMA>c:documentation</SCHEMA>.</p>

<p>When this attribute appears in a <SCHEMA>c:manual</SCHEMA>, then the
UnitRef is relative to the <code>documents</code> attribute of the
manual element (defaults to the current collection).</p>

=attribute fragment

<p>Refers to the thing within the Unit which is being documented.
This could be a unit which has a named relation (<SCHEMA>b:has</SCHEMA>),
or something else which has a <SCHEMA>b:Name</SCHEMA> in this unit:
any <SCHEMA>b:Reusable</SCHEMA> type will do.</p>
