<h1>The base schema</h1>

<blockquote style="border-left: 5px solid red">
Important design committees have demonstrated that you can build huge
schemas with very little expression power.  This has given XML (schemas)
a (deserved) bad name.  This base schema for MSI tries to avoid those
pitfalls with various shameless simplifications.
</blockquote>

<p>The elements in <i>base</i> use standards when they exist.  There are many
standards, and people have put a lot of effort in composing them.  Meshy Space
defines a uniform use of them.</p>

    will not show it, as it is XML: do "view source")</li>

<h2>The <code>unit</code></h2>

<p>This <b>base</b> schema defines the <SCHEMA>ms:unit</SCHEMA>
of operation.  It could have been named <i>object</i>, <i>atom</i>,
<i>item</i>, <i>entry</i>, <i>file</i>, <i>quantum</i>, or <i>blob</i>:
the unit is an sequence of octets (bytes) with some meaning.  When you
merge the features for these abstract thingies in many application,
you get a unified idea about managing data.</p>

<h2>Elements grouped in categories</h2>

<p>For easier access, the components defined by this schema are split
into a few accessible categories.  This is for documentation only: they form
one namespace and one XML schema.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a href="constants/">constants</a> in the <code>ms:</code> namespace.</dt>
<dd>many sets of namespaced constants are used, mainly to explictly refer to
    values defined in RFCs, IANA, and other standardization bodies.</dd>

<dt><a href="definitions/">definitions</a> contain logic.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>

<dt><a href="namespaces/">namespaces</a> are used to group units into
    manageable sets.  It defines transport and access.</dt>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>

<dt><a href="payloads/">payloads</a></dt>
<dd>contain the data of each unit (in-lined) or as reference.  Some payloads
    are native to the Meshy Space infrastructure.</dd>

<dt><a href="units/">units</a></dt>
<dd>addressable data units: the core feature of MSI.</dd>

<dt><a href="values/">values</a></dt>
<dd>representations of basic values, like expressions and numbers.</dd>
