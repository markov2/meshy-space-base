<h1>Constants defining MediaType</h1>

<p>MediaTypes explain what a sequence of bytes represents.
They are standardized by IETF via [% rfc(6838) %].  The
<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml"
>official list</a> is maintained by IANA.  For those types, use the
<code>iana:MediaType/</code> prefix.</p>

<p class="list">Example use of formats which have a IANA registration:</p>
<CODE>
iana:MediaType/image/gif
iana:MediaType/application/pdf
</CODE>

<p>Applications which handle IANA mime-types must handle them case-insensitive,
and expect that the "<code>x-</code>" may disappear in the future.</p>

<p>Hopefully, in the future IANA will maintain their own namespace of
their definitions within Meshy Space.  In that case, a simple namespace
redirection can be set-up to facilitate the transition.</p>

<h4>Missing MediaTypes</h4>

<p>You can freely create Mime-type look-alikes in your own namespace.  Of course,
when there is a strong preference to use the standard definitions, but IANA
registration processes are a lot of work and often overkill.</p>

<p>You MAY decide to organize your own MediaTypes in the same way as the
standard types, but there is not need for it.  Especially when the
payload of the unit is not an external source, it is useful to use
your own <code>myns:Type/</code> constants.</p>

<p class="list">Examples:</p>
<CODE>
myns:MediaType/application/warc.archive
myns:MediaType/application/vnd.osf.meeting
myns:Type/Warc/Archive
</CODE>
