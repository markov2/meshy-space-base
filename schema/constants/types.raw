<h1>Constants defining ms:Types</h1>

<p>The Meshy Space base object <SCHEMA>ms:unit</SCHEMA> is extremely
flexible, but not expressive.  The types listen below are used in
the <code>unit.meta.type</code> field to describe the extension of
the <SCHEMA>ms:Native</SCHEMA> payload to be expected.</p>

<p>See also the intelligent
<a href="/schemas/concept/constants/types.html">concept types</a>.</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>ms:Type/ChangeLog</code></dt>
<dd>Describes how the <SCHEMA>ms:unit</SCHEMA> has changed over time.</dd>

<dt><code>ms:Type/Constant</code></dt>
<dd>The unit contains information which relates to an address which is
    used as constant (<SCHEMA>ms:Constant</SCHEMA>).  It may keep track of
    the history of the constant, define ownership, and contain documentation.</dd>

<dt><code>ms:Type/Namespace</code></dt>
<dd>Defines a single namespace, and maintains its developments.  See
    <SCHEMA>ms:namespace</SCHEMA>.</dd>

<dt><code>ms:Type/Resource</code></dt>
<dd>Describes to get to data storage.  The data is octets, which are probably
    packed and compressed.  It may be part of a larger resource.
    (Computer people call Resources "files", "archives", "urls", or "zips")
</dd>

<dt><code>ms:Type/Rules</code></dt>
<dd>Most units have access restrictions: read, create, update, deprecate,
    expire, and so on, which are specified in a rule-set.
    (Computer people call this "permissions" or "access control lists (ACL)")
</dd>
