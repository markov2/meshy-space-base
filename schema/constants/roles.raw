<h1>Constants for Roles</h1>

<p>Meshy Space base object <SCHEMA>ms:unit</SCHEMA> has many relations.
The client MAY understand these relations.  The relations have a Role,
and end in a Unit of a certain <a href="types.html">Type</a>.
See also the <a href="/schemas/concept/constants/roles.html">concept Roles</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>is</code> attribute of the <SCHEMA>ms:has</SCHEMA> elements
in a <SCHEMA>ms:unit</SCHEMA> describe the relation.  When that value
is in the <code>ms:</code> namespace, you will find it described below.</p>

<p>Roles do not need to refer to Units with only one specific Type: the
application client must be able to handle (ignore) unexpected Types.</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>ms:Role/Subspace</code></dt>
<dd>Used as reference from a parent Namespace or Sub(name)space.  This
    will result in a <code>ms:Type/Namespace</code> Unit.
</dd>
</dl>
