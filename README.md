# meshy-space-base

Start with reading the [Meshy Space Website](https://meshy.space).

This repository is part of the
Meshy Space Interface (MSI) specification.  It defines the MSI components: the most static
elements in the Meshy Space infrastructure.  On top of this specification, you will use extensions
like [Meshy Space Concept](https://github.com/markov2/meshy-space-concept) (MSC), which live in
their own repositories.

Feel invited to contact [me](mailto:mark@overmeer.net) to discuss this project.
